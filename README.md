# hello-react-native

Getting started with React Native.

This project is a simple Counter, but the initial number to count from is inserted by the user.
I focused on three concepts:
* Hooks
* Context API
* Navigation

### Screens

1. The Home page with a simple "Hello" greeting;
2. The "Enter number" screen, where the user should insert the number that he/she wants to start counting from;
3. The "Counter" screen, where's the actual counting.


The counter only adds or subtracts 1 from the target number. The goal isn't to complex anything, only to get started with important React concepts.
